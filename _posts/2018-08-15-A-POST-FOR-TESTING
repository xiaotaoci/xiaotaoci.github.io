# Season 6

**Season 6** is the sixth season of *Steven Universe*. Little is known about this installment of the series, but what is known so far is that there are currently 32 planned episodes in the season<sup>[1]</sup>. The season was confirmed by Cartoon Network's official Instagram in the comments section of a post.<sup>[2]</sup>



### Trivia

- On February 15, 2017, Deedee Magno-Hall tweeted an image of Rebecca Sugar working at the recording studio. The production codes on the screen show "609" and "610", which hint at episodes 9 and 10 of the sixth season.<sup>[3]</sup>

- On April 30, 2018, Leisha Medina (the Latin American voice actor of Steven and Blue Diamond) tweeted that she is already working on and cannot confirm anything about Season 6.<sup>[4]</sup>

- There was a comment that was made on Cartoon Network's official Instagram where someone by the username of gmike0220 said "So sad, is this the last season 😰" and cartoonnetworkofficial replied to them "No, there's so more to come! 😉"<sup>[2]</sup>

- It is possible that Season 6 will have the standard 26-episode count instead of 32; the additional six episodes could make up the length of the movie (~90 minutes).



### References

1. At 03:28 of episode 8 of The Steven Universe Podcast, Jackie Buscarino says "So like, Season 4 was 16 half-hours, so that's 32 episodes all overlapping." Season 2 and Season 3 were originally formatted as a single 52-episode season. However, for unknown reasons, Cartoon Network relabeled the second half of the second season as Season 3 and then split the original third season into Season 4 and Season 5. This had no effect on production, meaning that the Season 5 episodes were/are still in production for Season 3. So for fans, Season 6 is the season after Season 5, but for producers, it would be Season 4. The 32-episode count doesn't line up with any other season.
